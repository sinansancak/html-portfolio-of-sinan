<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I’m Sinan Sancak, a backend developer with a strong foundation in C# and .NET Core, 
  and a background in chemistry. I recently completed a comprehensive backend developer training 
  program where I gained hands-on experience building RESTful APIs, working with Microsoft SQL 
  Server, implementing JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication, and designing scalable microservice 
  architectures.</p>

<p>My journey into software development started with curiosity and evolved into a passion 
  for creating efficient, clean, and maintainable backend and frontend systems. I enjoy solving 
  real-world problems with code and continuously improving my skills through practice 
  and projects.</p>

<p>Coming from a scientific background, I bring a strong analytical mindset, attention to 
  detail, and a structured approach to development. I’m especially interested in backend 
  technologies, system design, and performance optimization.</p>

<p>My goal is to grow as a professional web developer and contribute to meaningful projects
  that create real value.</p>
